## Hi, I'm Joshua

I teach Computer Science and occasionally make things.

This site brings together my projects, writing, and teaching resources.


## Tools & Projects

- [examTimer](/examTimer): A timer for use in in-class assessments
- [FrayerStore](https://frayerstore.streamlit.app/): A dictionary of Frayer Models (currently under heavy development)
- [Assessment reflection](https://assessment-reflection.streamlit.app/): A tool for guided assessment reflection (this needs lots of work)


## Blog

I haven't yet written anything but I am currently thinking hard about AI in schools.
I am working on an article at the moment.
